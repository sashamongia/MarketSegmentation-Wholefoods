# MarketSegmentation-Wholefoods


General Background

International Market Segmentation

Traditionally, international market segmentation is carried out based on country-level data, such as geographic, political, economic, and cultural characteristics, and the resultant market segments consisting of groups of nations, while within-country heterogeneity is ignored. However, groups of consumers in different countries often have more in common with each other than with those in closer geographical locations, including within the same country. This phenomenon is exacerbated by the non-stoppable trend of globalization, which has had profound impact on consumer behavior and attitudes that transcend national borders. A major challenge facing today’s global marketers is to identify international market segments and to reach them with products and marketing programs that meet the common needs of each segment. They need to keep in mind that market segmentation needs to take a consumer/customer-centric approach, and that international market segments often cut across national boundaries. If consumers or regions instead of countries were used as the basis for identifying international segments, the effectiveness of marketing strategies would be greatly enhanced. It is in this context that the current project is positioned.

International Food Retailing

The project is based on a large-scale study on supermarket store images and their drivers in a large number of European countries. In food retailing, international expansion has been a dominant growth strategy for large European retailers for decades (e.g., Carrefour, Metro, Tesco, Royal Ahold). For any retailers, to become successful abroad, the first step is to identify a viable target area where customer demand meets the retailer’s positioning strategy. Such areas usually involve regions across several countries. In their international expansion, retailers often employ so-called rollout strategies, which start from a market usually similar to their domestic market, and then successively enter neighboring regions to build up economies of scales. The context of this project is food retailing in European markets. With over $750 billion in sales a year, the food retailing industry is among the largest industries in the European Union. The top-ten food retailers are already present in virtually all EU countries and continue to expand internationally. 

Store Image

The goal of this project is to identify market segments based on drivers of store image and choose the entry strategy for a particular food retailer. Retailers achieve a distinctive positioning through the development of a unique store image. Store image has been found to relate to key indicators of retail success such as store visit frequency, store loyalty, and share-of-wallet. The drivers of store image include but are not limited to price perception (e.g., everyday low pricing), merchandise assortment (breadth, depth, premium quality, private labels, etc.), location convenience, service quality, store layout and atmosphere. Nonetheless, consumers may differ substantially in terms of the levels of importance they place on the various store image drivers. For example, price may be the most important store image driver for some consumers, while others may value service or store atmosphere more. International market segmentation based on the relative importance of different store image drivers can provide value insight for retailers to develop global expansion strategies.


The data for this project were collected as a part of a large-scale study on retail store image in seven European countries, sponsored by the European Commission. Before the data collection, extensive cross-national pretests were conducted. First, the store image instrument was tested for wording and interpretability. In a second stage, the questionnaires were refined in pretests conducted in France, the Netherlands, and Spain. Back-translation procedures were used to ensure that the contents of questionnaires were the same across languages. The fieldwork was carried out by the International marketing research company Gfk. Finally, mail surveys were sent out to households in a script panel who live in 105 regions across these seven countries. Each household was asked to identify its primary food retail outlet, defined as its most frequently visited food store, and then rate the overall store image as well as a variety of store image drivers of this store, on a 1-7 point Likert scale, where a higher score represents a more favorable rating.  (The identity of the primary food retail outlet for each participating household is collected but withheld in the dataset made available to us.) 

The variables in the dataset made available for this project include:

1.	REGION: the ID number for a region (there are 105 regions in the data, ranging from 1-120, with a few numbers absent).

2.	RESPONDENT: the ID number for a respondent within a region (= 1, 2, 3, …), each region may have a different number of respondents.

3.	STORE_IMAGE: Overall store image rating for a respondent’s primary food retail outlet, on a 1-7 point scale (missing values are imputed with their corresponding sample averages and thus may contain half points).

4.	SERVICE: Service quality perception of a respondent’s primary food retail outlet, on a 1-7 point scale (a store image driver).

5.	ATMOSPHERE: Store atmosphere perception of a respondent’s primary food retail outlet, on a 1-7 point scale (a store image driver).

6.	PRICE: Price perception of a respondent’s primary food retail outlet, on a 1-7 point scale (a store image driver). Note that higher value indicates more favorable price perception (i.e., low prices, reasonable prices).

Sample, countries and regions

The seven countries included in data are: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. The total sample consists of 1,669 respondents in 105 regions across the seven countries, classified by the so-called NUTS2 code. These regions are defined according to the EU Nomenclature des Unities Territoriales Statistique classification at level 2 (NUTS2), which includes the ‘regierungsbezirke’ in Germany, the ‘provincies’ in the Netherlands and Belgium, the ‘régions’ in France, the ‘comunidades autonomas’ in Spain, the ‘comissaoes de coordenaçao regional’ and ‘regioes autonomas’ in Portugal, and the ‘regioni’ in Italy. See the Figure below. 

In this project, we are interested in identifying segments of regions (rather than of consumers or countries) which vary in terms of the drivers of store image. This kind of segmentation is particularly useful for retailers to plan their international market expansion strategies. Efficiency in supply chain management is a critical consideration in retail market expansion decisions. Retailers usually adopt roll-out strategies and target spatially concentrated market segments to manage the accessibility of distribution centers and to enhance efficiency. 

You are expected to take on the role of a food retailer that is considering expanding to Europe, and to apply the data analysis to assist this retailer with its international expansion strategy. You can pick any US-based food retailer, although I would suggest Whole Foods (www.wholefoods.com). Your decision recommendations should include but not limited to:
•	Decide on which segment(s) to target;
•	Decide on where to enter (choose the regions); 
•	Decide on what positioning to choose;
•	Decide on how to roll out.


1.	Can you identify segments of regions that differ in terms of drivers of store image? How many segments are there? 
2.	How do the segments differ? What is the most important store image driver in each segment? How are the segments distributed across national borders? 
3.	What are the regions with the best opportunity for this retailer? How did you identify these regions?  
4.	What other factors did you consider in making your recommendations?
